### Hello internet traveller.

Welcome to my blog! I hope this can serve as a home for some of my projects, experiences, technical explorations, the things I find cool, or simply random scattered thoughts. With the speed and ease of information  in today's world from technologies like Google or AI, I believe it is valuable to slow down, relax, and have a corner of the internet where I can just talk and yap about the stuff I find interesting.

I think that at the end of the day, as humans, we are storytellers. We want others to learn, explore, and grow from our adventures (and also mis-adventures). So sit down, relax, and follow me as I document my past, present, and future journeys - and I hope throughout all this, you enjoy these as much as I do writing them.

Feel free to contact me anytime with questions, or if you just want to talk! Links out on the [home page](/).
